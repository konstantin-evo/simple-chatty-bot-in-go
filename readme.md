### Simple Chatty Bot in Go

This is a simple chat-bot project written in Go. It was created to help me become familiar with the basic syntax of the
Go programming language.

The bot can greet the user, ask their name, guess their age, count to a number specified by the user, and ask a simple
quiz question.

#### Getting Started

To run the bot, clone the repository and run the main.go file using the go run command:

```
git clone https://github.com/konstantin-evo/simple-chatty-bot-in-go.git
cd simple-chatty-bot-in-go
go run main.go
```

Once the bot is running, it will prompt the user with a series of questions and quizzes. Simply follow the instructions
on the screen to interact with the bot.

#### Features

The bot features the following interactions:

1. Greet the user and introduce itself
2. Ask the user for their name and provide a compliment
3. Guess the user's age based on remainders of dividing their age by 3, 5, and 7
4. Count to a specified number provided by the user
5. Quiz the user on a programming question
